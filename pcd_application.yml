##
# prepare|configure|deploy a application
#
#  1. specify the application to apply by passing the PCD_ROLE variable
#
#  2. -optionally- limit the hosts via --limit, and tasks via --tags 
#
#  e.g. ansible-playbook -i inventory/my.hosts pcd_application.yml \
#          --limit=webservers --tags=deploy -e PCD_ROLE=myapp
#    
#  + `prepare` tasks typically handle ONE-TIME prerequisites such as
#    dependency installations, user account creations, database setup, &c. 
#    
#  + `configure` tasks typically execute more often, whenever
#    configuration changes are made. E.g. to update a cron schedule
#
#  + `deploy` tasks typically execute most often, whenever a
#    application code changes and needs to be deployed
#
#  + If no tags are passed, all tasks will be executed.
